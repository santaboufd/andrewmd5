I was born and raised in Georgia, but now I divide my time between New York City and Paris. I've been a founder all my life, though not in the traditional sense. I took the bold step of dropping out of high school during my freshman year to dedicate myself fully to software development.

Over the years, I've developed and contributed to various projects. Here's a snapshot of my work:

- [Borderless Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming): A simple tool that allows gamers to play their games in a borderless window.
- [Netflix Roulette](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/netflix-roulette-3am-success-andrew-sampson/): An application that provides a random choice of Netflix content.
- [Aurous](https://www.billboard.com/pro/aurous-andrew-sampson-developer-explains/): A music streaming platform.
- [Ulterius](https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2016/10/10/ulterius-dials-in-with-open-source-remote-desktop-pc-management/?sh=184a9f2420dc): An open-source full-suite remote management solution for Windows.
- [The Forest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/): A first-person survival horror game.
- [Strike](https://torrentfreak.com/strike-torrent-search-goes-open-source-after-riaa-debacle-160130/): A torrent search engine.

In 2018, I founded [Rainway](https://github.com/RainwayApp), a project aimed at bringing cloud gaming to consumers. Today, technology derived from Rainway is used by major companies like [Microsoft](https://venturebeat.com/games/rainway-partners-with-microsoft-to-power-xbox-game-pass-ios-streaming/) to power their cloud streaming services.

Currently, I'm heading [Betwixt Labs](https://github.com/betwixt-labs), where we invent and incubate state-of-the-art technologies and mold them into viable products.

In my downtime, I enjoy writing and photography. To see some of my work, please visit my personal website, [andrew.im](https://andrew.im).
